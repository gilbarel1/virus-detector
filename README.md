## ðŸ“Œ About

This project is part of Lab B in Extended Labs in Systems Programming. It focuses on developing a virus detection system that scans files for known virus signatures and identifies potential infections.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Scans files for known virus signatures.
- Detects and reports infected files.
- Provides a sample infected file for testing purposes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `AntiVirus/`: Contains the main antivirus application.
- `AntiVirus.c`: Source code for the antivirus program.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for compiling the project.
- `exampleFile.txt`: Sample file used for testing the scanner.
- `hexaPrint.c`: Utility for printing file contents in hexadecimal format.
- `infected/`: Directory containing a sample infected file.
- `lab3_bubblesort.c`: Additional source code, possibly related to sorting algorithms.
- `signatures-B` and `signatures-L`: Files containing known virus signatures.
